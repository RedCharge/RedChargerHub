    {
        "id": 1,
        "type": "multiple_choice",
        "question": "Which of the following best defines critical thinking?",
        "options": [
            "A collection of personal opinions",
            "Disciplined thinking guided by intellectual standards",
            "The process of criticizing others",
            "Accepting claims based on emotion"
        ],
        "correct_answer": 1,
        "explanation": "Critical thinking is not about opinions or criticism, but rather a structured, disciplined approach to thinking that follows specific intellectual standards like clarity, accuracy, relevance, logic, and fairness."
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "type": "multiple_choice",
        "question": "Which intellectual standard is considered the 'gateway' because it is necessary to assess other standards like accuracy or relevance?",
        "options": [
            "Precision",
            "Logic",
            "Clarity",
            "Fairness"
        ],
        "correct_answer": 2,
        "explanation": "Clarity is often called the gateway standard because if a statement or argument is unclear or ambiguous, you cannot properly evaluate its accuracy, relevance, logic, or other qualities. You must first understand what is being said before you can assess its truth or validity."
    },
    {
        "id": 3,
        "type": "multiple_choice",
        "question": "A student states, 'The average room temperature is 25°C,' but a thermometer shows 30°C. This statement primarily lacks:",
        "options": [
            "Relevance",
            "Accuracy",
            "Completeness",
            "Consistency"
        ],
        "correct_answer": 1,
        "explanation": "Accuracy refers to being free from error or distortion. Since the statement (25°C) does not match the actual measurement (30°C), it is inaccurate. The statement could be clear and relevant but still wrong."
    },
    {
        "id": 4,
        "type": "multiple_choice",
        "question": "In critical thinking, an argument that is 'negatively relevant':",
        "options": [
            "Has no connection to the issue",
            "Provides reason to believe a claim is false",
            "Strongly supports the claim",
            "Is based on emotional appeal"
        ],
        "correct_answer": 1,
        "explanation": "Negative relevance means the evidence or reason counts against a claim, making it less likely to be true. It's still relevant because it bears on the issue, but in a negative way rather than a supporting one."
    },
    {
        "id": 5,
        "type": "multiple_choice",
        "question": "When someone asks, 'Could you be more specific?' they are applying which standard?",

            "Clarity",
            "Consistency",
            "Precision",
            "Fairness"
        ],
        "correct_answer": 2,
        "explanation": "Precision involves providing exact details, specific quantities, or concrete information. Asking for more specificity seeks to move from vague or general statements to more precise ones."
    },
    {
        "id": 6,
        "type": "multiple_choice",
        "question": "The phrase 'garbage in, garbage out' is used to stress:",

            "The need for quick thinking",
            "The importance of accurate information",
            "The value of diverse opinions",
            "The role of technology"
        ],
        "correct_answer": 1,
        "explanation": "This phrase emphasizes that the quality of output (conclusions, decisions) depends on the quality of input (information, data). Even perfect reasoning with inaccurate information will yield flawed results."
    },

            "Logical Irrelevance",
            "Lack of Depth"
        ],
        "correct_answer": 1,
        "explanation": "Logical inconsistency occurs when two or more beliefs contradict each other logically. They cannot all be true at the same time. For example, believing 'All humans are mortal' and 'Some humans are immortal' is logically inconsistent."
    },
    {
        "id": 8,
        "type": "multiple_choice",
        "question": "Which standard emphasizes open-mindedness and impartiality, particularly toward opposing views?",

            "Logic"
        ],
        "correct_answer": 2,
        "explanation": "Fairness requires giving a fair hearing to all relevant viewpoints, especially those we disagree with. It involves avoiding biases and treating opposing arguments with the same intellectual rigor we apply to our own."
    },
    {
        "id": 9,

            "Negatively relevant",
            "Logically irrelevant",
            "Logically correct"
        ],
        "correct_answer": 2,
        "explanation": "Logical irrelevance occurs when information has no logical connection to the claim being considered. It doesn't make the claim more or less likely to be true, no matter how interesting or true the information itself might be."
    },
    {
        "id": 10,
        "type": "multiple_choice",

            "Fairness"
        ],
        "correct_answer": 0,
        "explanation": "These questions check whether conclusions follow logically from premises and whether the reasoning is coherent. Logical correctness ensures that if the premises are true, the conclusion is properly supported."
    },
    {
        "id": 11,
        "type": "multiple_choice",
        "question": "Practical inconsistency is best demonstrated by a contradiction between:",

            "Two textbook definitions"
        ],
        "correct_answer": 1,
        "explanation": "Practical inconsistency (or hypocrisy) occurs when what someone says or believes conflicts with how they actually behave. For example, advocating for environmental protection while excessively polluting shows practical inconsistency."
    },
    {

        ],
        "correct_answer": 2,
        "explanation": "In critical thinking, 'critical' comes from the Greek 'kritikos' meaning 'able to discern or judge.' It involves careful, reflective, and analytical thinking rather than negative criticism."
    },
    {
        "id": 14,
